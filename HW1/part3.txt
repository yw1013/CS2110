1) What is the purpose of a splitter? Can it be used to join wires?
	* It is often useful to access each of the bits from the input individually. The splitter tool allows to route different bits in different directions.
	* Splitter can be used to join wires.
 2) Why are tunnels useful?
	* Tunnels are a very useful organizational tool to use when making circuits. They can be thought of as invisible wires; two wires with matching labels will act as if they are connected by a wire. They are not something that exist in real life but rather can be used to tidy up your circuits
 3) What is the output of your circuit when you give it an input of 010? How about an input of 100? 
	* 010: 0 (windy - no umbrella)
	* 100: 1 (advice - yes umbrella)
